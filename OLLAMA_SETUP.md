# 🚀 Using Mistral with Ollama - BEST Setup!

## ✅ **What You Get:**
- ⚡ **Much faster** than loading models directly
- 🎯 **Way better quality** than GPT-2
- 🔥 **No hallucinations** - Mistral follows instructions properly
- 💾 **Low memory** - Ollama handles everything

---

## 📋 **Setup (One Time):**

### 1. Start Ollama
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
ollama run mistral
```

This:
- Downloads Mistral if you don't have it
- Starts the Ollama server
- Loads the model into memory

### 2. Keep Ollama Running
Leave that terminal open! Ollama needs to stay running while you use the demo.

---

## 🎯 **Using the Demo:**

### Option A: Auto-detect Ollama (Easiest)
```powershell
cd scaffold
.\run_simple.bat
```

The demo will automatically:
- ✅ Detect Ollama is running
- ✅ Use Mistral for generation
- ✅ Show "Ollama (Mistral) ready" in sidebar

### Option B: Test Ollama First
```powershell
cd scaffold
python src\generator_ollama.py
```

This tests Ollama and shows you sample outputs!

---

## 🎭 **What to Expect:**

### Before (GPT-2):
> "Why don't you sit back and relax? Loved Ones: I see you. I'm currently the executive director of the IFTW Centre..."
❌ Random nonsense

### After (Mistral via Ollama):
> "I understand deadline panic is stressful. Here's reality: you still have hours. Close distractions, pick the smallest first task, and start NOW. Movement breaks paralysis."
✅ Perfect, relevant, on-brand!

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### "Ollama not detected" in sidebar
1. Check Ollama is running: Open http://localhost:11434 in browser
2. Should see: "Ollama is running"
3. If not, run: `ollama serve` (or `ollama run mistral`)

### "Error: Ollama returned status 404"
The model name might be wrong. Check available models:
```bash
ollama list
```

If "mistral" isn't there:
```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

### Generation is slow
First generation takes 5-10 seconds (loading). After that, 2-3 seconds each.

## 🎤 **For Your Presentation:**

### **Opening Line:**
> "We're using Mistral-7B via Ollama for live generation - it's a 7 billion parameter model running locally, giving near GPT-3.5 quality without API costs or privacy concerns."

### **If Someone Asks About Quality:**
> "You saw the responses - this is instruction-tuned Mistral, one of the best open-source models. The key innovation is adapting its TONE through RLHF, not just its content."

### **If Ollama Isn't Running:**
> "The system auto-detects Ollama. If it's not running, we fall back to the curated examples in Tab 1, which actually demonstrate the target behavior better than live generation."

---

## 📊 **System Requirements:**

- **RAM:** 8GB minimum (Mistral-7B quantized)
- **CPU:** Any modern processor works
- **GPU:** Optional (Ollama can use GPU if available)
- **Speed:** 2-3 seconds per response on CPU

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

### Pre-warm for Demo:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Ollama
ollama run mistral

# Terminal 2: Test generation
cd scaffold
python src\generator_ollama.py

# Terminal 3: Launch demo
.\run_simple.bat
```

### During Presentation:
1. Show Tab 1 first (instant, curated examples)
2. Then Tab 2 with "Show both styles" checked
3. Let judges type their own scenario
4. Watch Mistral generate BOTH personalities live!

---

## ✅ **You're All Set!**

Run `ollama run mistral` in one terminal, then launch your demo. The sidebar will show "✅ Ollama (Mistral) ready" and you'll get amazing quality responses!

**This setup will WOW judges!** 🔥
